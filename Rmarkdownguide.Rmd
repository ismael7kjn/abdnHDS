## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Text Formatting Basics
### Headers

# First Level Header

## Second Level Header

### Third Level Header

Tip: Insert a blank line between each line of code to separate them at output. And always have at least one blank line in between format elements that are adjacent, but different from each other, such as section headers and body text.

### Bulleted or Numbered Lists

* List element 1
* List element 2
* List element 3
 * List item 3a
 * List item 3b

Numbered Lists:

1. Numbered list 1
1. Numbered list 2
1. Numbered list 3.


### Text Formatting

* Make text italic like *this* or _this_. 
* Make text bold like **this** or __this__.
* Use `backticks` for code.
* Wrap a character to subscript in tildes (~). For example, H~2~O renders as H~2~O.
* Wrap a character to superscript in carets (^), like this: R^2^ renders as R^2^.

### Code Chunks
To run blocks of code in R Markdown, use code chunks. Insert a new code chunk with:

Command + Option + I on a Mac, or Ctrl + Alt + I on Linux and Windows.
Another option is the “Insert” drop-down Icon in the toolbar and selecting R.
We recommend learning the shortcut to save time! We’ll insert a new code chunk in our R Markdown Guide in a moment.


### Running Code

Before running code chunks it is often a good idea to restart your R session and start with a clean environment. Do this with Command + Shift + F10 on a Mac or Control + Shift + F10 on Linux and Windows.

To save time, it’s worth learning these shortcuts to run code:

- Run all chunks above the current chunk with Command + Option + P on a Mac, or Ctrl + Alt + P on Linux and Windows.
- Run the current chunk with Command + Option + C or Command + Shift + Enter on a Mac. On Linux and Windows, use Ctrl + Alt + C or Ctrl + Shift + Enter to run the current chunk.
-Run the next chunk with Command + Option + N on a Mac, or Ctrl + Alt + N on Linux and Windows.
- Run all chunks with Command + Option + R or Command + A + Enter on a Mac. On Linux and Windows, use Ctrl + Alt + R or Ctrl + A + Enter to run all chunks.


### Control Behaviour with Code Chunk Options

- echo = FALSE: Do not show code in the output, but run code and produce all outputs, plots, warnings and messages. The code chunk to generate a plot in the image below is an example of this.
- eval = FALSE: Show code, but do not evaluate it.
- fig.show = "hide": Hide plots.
- include = FALSE: Run code, but suppress all output. This is helpful for setup code. You can see an example of this in the top code chunk of the image below.
- message = FALSE: Prevent packages from printing messages when they load. This also suppress messages generated by functions.
- results = "hide": Hides printed output.
- warning = FALSE: Prevents packages and functions from displaying warnings.


### Inline Code

Directly embed R code into an R Markdown document with inline code. This is useful when you want to include information about your data in the written summary. We’ll add a few examples of inline code to our R Markdown Guide to illustrate how it works.

Use inline code with r and add the code to evaluate within the backticks. For example, here’s how we can summarize the number of rows and the number of columns in the cars dataset that’s built-in to R:

The `cars` dataset contains `r nrow(cars)` rows and `r ncol(cars)` columns.

The example above highlights how it’s possible to reduce errors in reports by summarizing information programmatically. If we alter the dataset and change the number of rows and columns, we only need to rerun the code for an accurate result. This is much better than trying to remember where in the document we need to update the results, determining the new numbers, and manually changing the results. R Markdown is a powerful because it can save time and improve the quality and accuracy of reports.


### Navigating Sections and Code Chunks


Naming code chunks is useful for long documents with many chunks. With R code chunks, name the chunk like this: {r my_boring_chunk_name}.

With named code chunks, you can navigate between chunks in the navigator included at the bottom of the R Markdown window pane. This can also make plots easy to identify by name so they can be used in other sections of your document. This navigator is also useful for quickly jumping to another section of your document.


### Table Formatting

As mentioned earlier in this post, tables in R Markdown are displayed as you see them in the R console by default. To improve the aesthetics of a table in an R Markdown document, use the function knitr::kable(). Here’s an example:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "The First Few Rows of the Cars Dataset")
```


### Output Format Options

Now that we have a solid understanding about how to format an R Markdown document, let’s discuss format options. Format options that apply to the entire document are specified in the YAML header. R Markdown supports many types of output formats.

The metadata specified in the YAML header controls the output. A single R Markdown document can support many output formats. Recall that rendering to HTML is generally faster than PDF. If you want to preview your document in HTML but will eventually output your document as a PDF, comment-out the PDF specifications until they are needed, like this.


### Presentations

The rmarkdown package supports four types of presentations. Other R packages are available, such as revealjs, that expand the capabilities of R Markdown. We’ll briefly outline the presentation formats that are built-into R Markdown, and then we’ll look at an example.

The four presentation options and the format they output to are:

- beamer_presentation: PDF
- ioslides_presentation: HTML
- powerpoint_presentation: Microsoft Powerpoint
- slidy_presentation: HTML


### Add a Table of Contens

output:
 html_document:
        toc: true
